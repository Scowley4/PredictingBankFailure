# PredictingBankFailure

Two projects done for ACME at BYU.

The project [Analyzing Failed FDIC Banks](https://github.com/Scowley4/PredictingBankFailure/blob/master/analyzing_failed_fdic_banks.pdf) was done for Math 402 taught by Dr. Jarvis during Fall 2017. This project analyzes and prepares the data, using primarily data visualization to make find patterns in bank failure.

The project [Predicting FDIC Bank Failure](https://github.com/Scowley4/PredictingBankFailure/blob/master/predicting_fdic_bank_failure.pdf) was done for Math 404 taught by Dr. Jarvis during Winter 2018. This project uses trends found in the above project and implementes machine learning methods to predict the failure of banks.
